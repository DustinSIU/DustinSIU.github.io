    			<th>Service</th>

 			</tr>
  			<tr>
   				<td>Director</td>
    			<td>Directors audition and cast actors; assemble and oversee the production team; provide design directives; lead rehearsals; and manage the production schedule of the project, ensuring that all the moving parts connect</td>
    			<td>Starting at $1500</td>
				
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
    			<td>Technical Direction</td>
    			<td>The technical director is responsible for operating, protecting, and maintaining the theaterâ€™s technical assets, while also managing and overseeing the different technical departments, including set, lighting, costumes, props, sound, and effects. They serve a dual role, acting sometimes as technical experts and advisors, and others as project coordinators.</td>
    			<td>Starting at $1500</td>
				
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
    			<td>Stage Management</td>
    			<td>Stage managers facilitate communication across all creative and technical departments; act as a right hand to the director; oversee sets, props, lights, and sound; and call all technical cues during performances. Although the details of the role vary depending on the art form in question, stage managers in all disciplines are broadly responsible for ensuring that the production runs smoothly from first rehearsal to final curtain call.</td>
    			<td>Starting at $800</td>
				
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
    			<td>Set Design</td>
    			<td>Set designers, or scenic designers, are responsible for the worlds that characters on the stage and screen inhabit: from the rooms, buildings, and outdoor spaces they move through to the pieces of furniture that fill them, and even aspects of presentation like the set's angle. All of it tells a story to the audience, and it's the job of the set designer to ensure that the director's vision comes across in the visual language of scenic design. </td>
    			<td>Starting at $800</td>
				
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
    			<td>Lighting and Sound Design</td>
    			<td>Lighting designers marshal the transformative power of light to illuminate performers, focus an audience's eyes, support a narrative, and trigger emotions. The work varies greatly depending on the setting, and may revolve around something as concrete as a script or as ambiguous as an atmosphere or mood.</td>
    			<td>Starting at $800</td>
